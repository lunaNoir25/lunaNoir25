# Welcome!

Hello! I'm Luna Moonlit Noir, a Canadian Computer Nerd with a passion for a broad spectrum of technology, including Hardware, Software, IoT, and IT.

I have Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome (HRHS) and am always open to learning new skills.

I am proficient in several key programming languages:
 - Python
 - Java
 - C#
 - C++
 - Rust
 - Microsoft QuickBasic
 - Open to learn more!

Current Project Focus:

Languages:

 - Canadian English and French
 - Yes, Canada has their own variant of English, America isn't the only country who speaks English. Keep this in mind when adding
   translations to your software. If I don't see Canadian English or British English, I consider it not widely available.
